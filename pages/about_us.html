        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h2>Hello and welcome to Simply Recipes</h2>
        <p>There are two things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on the site.</p>
        <p>First, does it work? Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves?</p>
        <p>Second, if the dish tastes great, is it worth the effort? Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?</p>
        <p>This is what we strive for—recipes you can rely on to work every time and be worth your time, effort, and $$ to make!

Do you have a recipe binder or a box of recipe cards? Think of this site as us sharing our recipe box with you. Our recipes are all tested in our own kitchens, usually several times.

Please try the recipes and if you have a question or constructive feedback, let us know about it in the comments to the recipe.</p>
        <h2>How we got started</h2>
        <p>Simply Recipes was founded by Elise Bauer in 2003 as a blog to keep track of the recipes she was learning to cook from her parents in Carmichael, California.

Elise had been a busy Silicon Valley executive when in 2001 she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away. In 2003 Elise moved home with her parents (then in their 70s, now in their 80s) to help recover. Elise lived with her parents for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes.</p>
        <h2>Fast forward to today</h2>
        <p>The company that started in 2003 in Elise’s parents’ kitchen has grown to reach millions of site visitors every month! When we started, there were only a handful of food blogs and websites sharing recipes online. Our goal was (and still is) to encourage people to cook at home, and to make the process of feeding your family and loved ones less intimidating and more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>In 2016, after 13 years of running Simply Recipes solo, Elise decided she wanted to work with a team and collaborate with others as devoted as she is to high quality, accessible, home cooking. Simply Recipes joined forces with Fexy Media, a Seattle-based media company who also owns Serious Eats and Road Food.</p>
