              <p>
  Moist and delicious banana bread recipe. Easy to make, no need for a mixer! Ripe bananas, butter, sugar, egg, vanilla, baking soda, and flour.
  Banana Bread
  Because it really is the best banana bread recipe, period. You can mix everything in one bowl, you can vary the amount of sugar or bananas. And the secret to its great flavor? Melted butter.

The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don’t need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 of a cup, and many are happy with a 1/2 cup.

You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, or put the batter into muffin tins and make banana nut muffins instead. You can even go a step further and make chocolate banana bread.

I was given this banana bread recipe years ago from my friend Heidi H, who, many years before, had begged the recipe from a ski buddy’s mother—Mrs. Hockmeyer. Thanks Heidi!</p>

              <p>
                BEST Vegetarian Chili! With eggplant, plum tomatoes, onion, garlic, zucchini, bell peppers, jalapeños, white beans, kidney beans, and cilantro. With vegetarian chili this good, you will never miss the meat!
                Those of you who have been reading Simply Recipes for a while probably sense (rightly) that my father is a committed carnivore.

Thus, you may appreciate that dad, spending an afternoon making this vegetarian chili with vegetables that he had bought at the farmers market that morning, would only put so much care into a meat-free chili, his dinner, if that chili were darn good.

This vegetarian chili is that good.
  The level of spiciness in this vegetarian chili will depend on how much chili powder, and how many jalapeños you put in the chili. If you like things on the mild side, start with the smaller amounts of both, and add to taste.

              <p>
                Pasta? Check. Roasted tomatoes? Check. Creamy vegan cashew sauce? Absolutely CHECK! This recipe is so simple, but it delivers big on both flavor and creaminess. Make the cream sauce ahead of time and dinner is ready in no time.
                The soft texture of the cashews puree into the creamiest of sauces to the point of where I don’t even miss the cream. The sauce is similar in texture to Alfredo and comes together by simply soaking raw cashews in a bit of water. Add the fresh herbs, and this sauce is up there as a favorite of mine.
                One of my food weaknesses is a pasta tossed with cream sauce. The richness from the sauce always feels like a satisfying dinner, and I’ve yet to meet a vegetable that doesn’t go well when paired with a creamy sauce.

Of course, when cooking a vegan meal, using heavy cream is out. For these times, cashew cream is my go-to replacement.
              Best of all, this is a great year-round sauce to use with any pasta recipe. Make this recipe with roasted butternut squash in the fall or some pan-fried asparagus in the spring. Still delicious.

              <p>
                This easy noodle stir-fry comes together in just over ten minutes! Leave the take-out menu in the drawer and make this one at home.
                Ok, a disclaimer before we get started: The Pu Pu Platter in a Chinese restaurant isn’t something you would find in a restaurant in China. And Singapore noodles are unknown in Singapore.

My Singaporean friend was surprised when he noticed the item on a Chinese restaurant menu here in the United States, and couldn’t imagine where it was from.
This dish—a popular Chinese take-out menu item—is a stir-fry made with rice noodles, lots of crisp vegetables, shrimp, strips of ham, and scrambled eggs. Curry powder is a seasoning, but lots of flavor also comes from a simple sauce of soy, rice vinegar, and Asian sesame oil.

Whoever invented the dish is brilliant. You get crunch, heat, salt, sweet, smoke, and aromatics all at once. All the ingredients are added to the pan in stages, and from start to finish, it takes just over ten minutes.
Like all stir-fries, this dish cooks very quickly, so it’s best to be completely prepared before you start. Peel shrimp, cut the ham into strips, and chop the vegetables. Cook the rice sticks and scramble a couple of eggs.

Line up all the prepped ingredients so they’re right beside your pan, and you’re ready. A large, well-seasoned wok is ideal, but lacking that, use a 12-inch skillet, which is what I use.

              <p>
                  These Crispy Air Fryer Chickpeas are made for last-minute holiday guest appearances. They're quick to make and are best served as soon as they're made. Season them up however you like and in ten minutes you'll have a crunchy, savory snack ready to go.
                  There’s an endless need for quick, tasty snacks you can put out for guests around the holidays. Savory ones are even better, because we’re typically confronted with a glut of sugar and we really crave something to balance all that sweetness.

Air fried chickpeas are my favorite go-to snack for just this very reason.
I’ve found that the air fryer is a far superior device for making these nutty, popcorn-like nuggets.

The secret? The small surface area of the chickpeas, plus the compact nature of the air fryer basket and the constant circulation of hot air, equals air-fried chickpea perfection. Every aspect of every chickpea comes into contact with the air because they rest in a basket that allows for circulation. On a baking sheet, you don’t get that.

Sure, you could roast these chickpeas in the oven, and I’ve certainly done that and it’s delicious, but it takes quite a bit longer than air frying. And you don’t get that all over crispiness that the air fryer creates.
